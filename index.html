				<h1>Biography</h1>
				<p><strong>Nikola Tesla </strong> was a Serbian inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
				<p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.</p>
				<p>Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</p>

	      <h2>Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla life:</h2>
	      <ul>
	        <li><strong>1856 Nikola Tesla is born.</strong><br/>During his birth, lightning struck during a summer storm. He is born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan.</li>
	        <li><strong>1875 Tesla Enrolls In College.</strong><br/>Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams.</li>
	        <li><strong>1881 Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer.</strong><br/>In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical engineer.</li>
	        <li><strong>1882 Tesla Goes To Work For Edison.</strong><br/>In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems.</li>
	        <li><strong>1885 Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents.</strong><br/>Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass media who sought his solutions.</li>
	        <li><strong>1887 Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor.</strong><br/>Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits, especially in long-distance power transmission.</li>
	        <li><strong>1891 Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission.</strong><br/>He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience.</li>
	        <li><strong>1891 Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil.</strong></li>
	        <li><strong>1943 Tesla's Death</strong><br/>In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York.</li>
	      </ul>
